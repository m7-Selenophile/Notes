$ ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

Once you got logged in :

Try the following command

$ cat data.txt

you can see output as 

survival        sGNRNzRRbfawPRxFp7hTHRoNzF6cMVP0
nominates       esv5iUa3c6nGJYWRos1rJG1NLwqYDW2g

Its so ridiculous that there are lost of data.
Question hint the password is next to millionth

$ cat data.txt | grep millionth

command meaning:

|       -> used to send data to another command
grep    -> Its is used to match the word and print

we got output :
millionth       cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

Thus cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV is password for bandit8

Boom!!!
