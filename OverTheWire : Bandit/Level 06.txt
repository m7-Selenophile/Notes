user : bandit6
password : DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7

$ ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

Once you got logged in :

Try the following things..

[ We have following hints ]

The password has following properties

1. owned by user bandit7
2. owned by group bandit6
3. 33 bytes in size

Now lets run the command

$ find / -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6

Here command meaning 
/               -> start searching form root directory
-size 33c       -> 33 is number and c denotes bytes
-user uname     -> To determine the user
-group gname    -> To determine the group

You can also try the following command

First change directory to root 

$cd / 

Then run the command as 
$ find ./ -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6

But we are getting lots of error message i.e stderr standard output with the standard output i.e. stdout

To tackel this one we can use the following command

$ find / -size  33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null

command meaning 
2               -> standard error i.e. stderr
>/dev/null      -> To send the data to null directory

After running the following command we see output

/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

To read  the file use command

$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

Boom we got the password.
