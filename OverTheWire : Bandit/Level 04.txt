Its a directory
$ cd inhere #To change directory to inhere
$ ls #To see the content of the directory

sh*t there are lots of files. And I am a Lazy guy.

So in question there is a hint that the file which is in human readble for is the right one

Lets find out.

We know human readble form is ASCII text.

$ file ./-file0* 
-file0* means that file name -file01, -file02 ..

$ file ./-file0* | grep ASCII 
to grep only the ASCII one 

$ cat ./-file07

Boom we got the password koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
