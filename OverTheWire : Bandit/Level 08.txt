$ ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

Once you got logged in :

[Hint we have 'The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once']

Try the following command
$ cat data.txt

Its too much crazy to see this much data 

$ cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u

command meaning:

sort    -> used to sort the data in a file
uniq    -> check for command to find unique one 
-u      -> To check the uniq line only

The output which is password for bandit9
